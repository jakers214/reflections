-How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file
help you see the bug that was introduced?

-- The side by side comparison was great. I prefer the
windows method over the mac one to be honest as the +/-
display looked a bit wonky.

- how could having easy access to the entire history of a
file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

-- debugging is a no brainer on how this would be easier.
but also bringing back old design or functionality would be
easier as well.

- What do you think are the pros and cons of manually
choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs
having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

-- pros: more logical save points. easier to read diff.
cons: possibility of losing saves and work.

- Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like
Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-- I would assume the overhead of tracking multiple files
is more complicated, and not necessary for the vast
majority of use cases in the situations users use things
like Google Docs.

- how can you use the commands in git log and git diff
to view the history of files?

-- using git log will help find the comment and kind of
change im looking for while the diff will show the details.

- What do you want to use git for?

-- understanding how version control works with the devs.
